# Learning Odoo Development

This repository contains various implementations based on Odoo development tutorials. Below are the key features and concepts learned throughout the series.

## 1. Creating a New Module in Odoo
A module in Odoo is an independent functional unit containing components like models, views, and actions. Creating a new module allows developers to add or modify features in Odoo. This process involves setting up an appropriate structure with necessary files like `__init__.py`, `__manifest__.py`, and model definitions.

## 2. Form View in Odoo
The form view is the primary interface used to view and edit detailed records in Odoo. This type of view provides users with a structured way to input data into Odoo models. It is highly customizable to fit various business needs and can include features like conditional fields, tabs, and smart buttons.

## 3. Kanban View in Odoo
Kanban view is a card-based representation of data used for task management or workflow processes. It provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface to manage records, such as tasks or opportunities. The Kanban view is useful for visualizing the status of records across different stages.

## 4. One2many and Many2one Relationships in Odoo
Odoo uses relational fields such as One2many and Many2one to link models together. A One2many field represents a one-to-many relationship, while a Many2one field links a record to another model. These relationships are essential for handling complex data structures like orders and their line items.

## 5. Many2many Relationship in Odoo
The Many2many field creates a many-to-many relationship between two models. This is useful for scenarios where a record can be related to multiple records from another model and vice versa. For example, a product can belong to multiple categories, and a category can contain multiple products.

## 6. Onchange in Odoo
Onchange is a mechanism that allows developers to trigger specific actions when a field value changes, without saving the record. This is useful for providing real-time feedback to the user, such as auto-filling certain fields based on the input in others.

## 7. Compute Fields in Odoo
Compute fields are dynamically calculated fields that are not stored in the database. Instead, their values are computed in real-time based on other fields. This is commonly used for calculations such as totals, percentages, or derived values that don’t need to be saved.

## 8. Button Actions in Odoo
Odoo allows developers to add custom buttons to views, which can trigger specific Python functions. This is useful for scenarios where a user needs to perform actions like confirming orders, approving requests, or generating reports directly from the interface.

## 9. Attributes / `attrs` in Odoo XML
Attributes in Odoo XML (`attrs`) are used to control the visibility and behavior of fields based on specific conditions. For example, fields can be shown, hidden, or made read-only depending on the state of the record, improving the user experience and enforcing business rules.

## 10. Domain in Odoo
Domains are filters applied to data in Odoo to restrict the records displayed in views or selectable in relational fields. For example, a domain can be used to display only active products or filter orders based on a specific customer.

## 11. Search, Filter, and Group By in Odoo Tree View
Tree views can be customized to include search bars, filters, and group-by functionalities. These features allow users to efficiently navigate through large datasets, group records by certain criteria, and find relevant records quickly.

## 12. Naming with Prefix in `ir.sequence`
Odoo provides the `ir.sequence` model for automatically generating unique, sequential numbers for records like invoices, orders, or tickets. Developers can customize these sequences by adding prefixes, suffixes, and specific numbering patterns to suit business needs.

## 13. Error Handling in Odoo
Odoo allows developers to implement custom error messages that enhance user experience by providing clear feedback when certain conditions are not met. This can be done using the `raise` keyword, which enables throwing specific exceptions tailored to the business logic.

## 14. Creating Popup Views (Wizard Views)
Wizard views are essential for interactive user dialogs in Odoo. They allow developers to create step-by-step workflows or data input dialogs. These popups are configured via views and can trigger specific actions, improving the overall user interaction within the system.

## 15. Inheriting Models and Extending Functionality
One of the core strengths of Odoo is the ability to inherit existing models and extend their functionality. This enables adding new fields or buttons without modifying the original code. By using inheritance, developers can safely customize and adapt Odoo models according to specific requirements.

## 16. Server Actions and Automations
Server actions provide a way to execute automated tasks in Odoo, such as updating records, sending emails, or triggering custom logic based on conditions. This feature plays a crucial role in reducing manual work and ensuring automated processes align with business needs.

## 17. Implementing Cron Jobs and Schedulers
Odoo supports the creation of scheduled tasks using Cron jobs. These tasks allow repetitive actions, such as updating data or sending reports, to be automated and run at specific intervals without user intervention.

## 18. Generating PDF Reports with QWeb
QWeb is the templating engine used for generating reports in Odoo. Developers can create professional-grade PDF reports by defining custom templates. These reports are fully customizable and can include any data stored in the Odoo database, making them highly versatile for business needs.

## 19. Customizing and Generating Excel Reports
Excel reports are another powerful tool in Odoo for exporting data. Developers can define custom templates and formats for generating these reports, which are especially useful for data analysis and external reporting purposes.

## 20. QR Code and Barcode Integration
Odoo provides native support for generating and reading QR codes and barcodes, which can be used to streamline processes such as inventory management, product tracking, and user identification. This functionality is highly valuable for businesses that rely on efficient data capture methods.

## 21. Importing Excel Files into Odoo
Odoo also allows importing data from Excel files, providing a user-friendly interface for bulk data entry. This is particularly useful for onboarding large datasets into Odoo, reducing the need for manual data entry and minimizing errors during the import process.

## 22. Developing REST APIs for Integration
Odoo supports the development of REST APIs, allowing integration with external systems. Through the use of GET and POST methods, developers can create APIs that interact with Odoo’s models, enabling seamless data transfer between Odoo and other platforms. This capability is essential for businesses looking to synchronize data across different systems or provide external access to their Odoo environment.

## 23. XML-RPC for Remote Procedure Calls
XML-RPC is another protocol supported by Odoo for remote communication. This method allows external applications to interact with Odoo’s backend, enabling operations such as creating records, updating data, or fetching information programmatically from a remote location.
